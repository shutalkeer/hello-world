# hello-world (complete, respect +++)
The second trying XD
Well, now I can create a lot of /*useless*/ repositories with my /*awful*/ projects I will /*not*/ work in the future /*because I'm pretty bad at programming*/. Also I have studied basic tools that will help me to work with my projects easier and faster. Under the word 'tools' I mean such services like opening an issue, creating some branches e.t.c. In fact, I'm writing this just because I want to practise my English. London is a capital of Great Britain.
